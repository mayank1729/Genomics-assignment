- Improvements in Neural Network over lPCA dataset (Reduced randomness of the mini batch gradient descent utilized in the neural network) 
- Significant improvements in SLE (utilized SVM and XGBoost) after testing and verifying the model over the different datasets available in comparison to the individual models over the same datasets.



13th October 2020


- Modified test dataset for convenience

- Utilized SLE (Super Learner Ensemble) to achieve a prediction at least as good as the best model within the ensemble.

- Improvements in XGBoost, SVM and logistic regression after tuning the models and utilizing column modified and SMOTE datasets.



12th October 2020

- Tested models over chi square dataset with the aim of reducing the number of features to a value less than but greater than the total number of features and reduced dimesionality respectively.
- Modified lPCA dataset to be utilized with the models being considered



11th October 2020

- Improvements in Neural Network predictions
 over lPCA dataset
- Utilized SVM and stacking ensemble method
. Dimensionality reduction techniques did not produce better results, due to which feature maps were opted for.
- Improvements in logistic regression after using SMOTE dataset.


9th October 2020

- Created Logistic PCA dataset
- Improvements in predictions for XGBoost
- Utilized logistic regression and random forest models


8th October 2020

- Found out the ratio of class imbalance between majority to minority class
- Utilized Chi-sqaure to produce new dataset (the chi-square dataset)
- Utilized oversampling to resolve class imbalance
- Threshold for SMOTE was provided (Values which range between (0,1) were transformed to either 0 or 1 depending on whether the value was < or > 0.5)


7th October 2020

- Found the columns containing the missing values (3 columns) and removed them to make the column modified dataset.
- Created SMOTE dataset to resolve class imbalance.
- Tunned XGBoost and Neural Network to produce better results.
- Tested predictions of the models over created datasets.


2nd October 2020

- Decided upon intial models to be utilized (XGBoost and Neural Network). These models were selected taking into consideration several factors (like the class imbalance problem)
- Inspected dataset provided
- Studied reference papers provided
- Uploaded datasets which have rows without -1 output (modified_dataset) and rows without -1 as input feature using modified_dataset (row_deletion)
