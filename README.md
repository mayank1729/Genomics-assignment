# Genomics-assignment
Tuberculosis drug resistance classification 

# Description 
The objective of the assignment is to produce a machine learning/statistical model that improves the predictive performance of Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) for a set of first and second line drugs. Provided a set of mutations as features, we are to fit a model on the data provided and predict whether a sample is resistant or susceptible to a particular drug. Eleven drugs were taken into consideration which are first-line drugs (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol); streptomycin; second-line injectable drugs (capre- omycin, amikacin, and kanamycin); and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and ofloxacin). This report provides a description of the steps taken in creating the models, the processing of datasets and the results inferred from the trained models. The report also provides a reasoning and analysis of the models performance over
the datasets. <br/>
